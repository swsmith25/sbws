Controlling the bite
Placing a hand in the mouth
Settles my heart
Better to know than to jump at every twitch of the muzzle
I have been hunted
My past ignorance ignites present fears

Included with the brochure and emergency procedures
Updated versions
They still include the doggy bag. 

Nostalgia comes over me at this odd emblem of tradition.
Carpetted floors are still hurt from past abuse
And I remember my classmates in elementary
How involuntary hurl seemed a normal part of the week 
Just as the daily reading journal binder 
With my mother's forged signatures.

She was the one who taught me how to curl the J like hers.
Dont make it to big and swoopy
The tail is less pronounced
Her letters looko less like mine
But the way I write my name reminds me of my father.

Do people still use the doggy bag?
Is it really that necessary? 
There arent any other emergency supplies as readily available as her.
I'm glad that she is still there.
I miss life with my mother.
